# Snake Game

## Introduction
This project implements a Snake Game using an OLED Display and an Arduino board. The game allows the player to control a snake, eat food to grow, and avoid collisions with the snake's own body. The game is displayed on an OLED screen, making it an engaging and interactive experience.

## Features
- Snake movement controlled by buttons (left, right, up, down)
- Dynamic display on an OLED screen
- Food generation and snake growth mechanics
- Game over and win conditions with sound effects

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino board
- OLED Display
- Buttons for directional control
- Potentiometer for speed control
- Buzzer for sound effects
- LED for visual feedback

## Installation
1. Connect the required hardware components to your Arduino board.
2. Install necessary libraries (e.g., hd44780, Adafruit_SSD1306) using the Arduino IDE or your preferred method.
3. Upload the Snake Game sketch to your Arduino board.

## Usage
1. Power up your Arduino board.
2. Use the directional buttons to control the snake.
3. Adjust the speed using the potentiometer.
4. Enjoy the game on the OLED display.
